One of our assignments in my infographics class was to create an infographic based on a shared dataset, so that we could get the opportunity to interpret the data from our own perspective.</p><p>I wanted to focus on the differences between those who survived the Titanic disaster and those lost. The top half of the document summarizes the survivors, including the passenger demographic that was most likely to survive. The bottom half focuses on the distribution between the survivors and the perished, and how the latter was far higher.</p>",
