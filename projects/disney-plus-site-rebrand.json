The site's former url (disneyplusoriginals.disney.com) needed an update to reflect how the site's content would include more titles that are available on the streaming platform. Without needing to migrate all of the content from its former site to another one, I helped the production team by ensuring that all former urls would properly redirect to their updated counterparts and coordinated the launch of this site's new url with our infrastructure team.</p>",
