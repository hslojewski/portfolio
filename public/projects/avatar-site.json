As a web developer, I contributed to the site's style theming (specific to the Avatar brand) and I also built new features that aided with this migration in addition to benefiting other websites that live on the same CMS platform.</p><p>In particular, I contributed a lot of work to support the creation of the \"Our Team\" section of the site, which features a landing page introducing site guests to the team, with each member having their own bio page. An example of the work I supported included the configurability of having separate top-aligned and bottom-aligned background images for each page, regardless of the varying amounts of content across each team member's information.",
