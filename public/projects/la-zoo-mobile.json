While this encourages visitors to go to the zoo, it is limited in both the variety of information it provides (the zoo contains 250+ species and more activities) and in its capability for users to recall memories through the app.</p><p>This new app will improve the experience by providing a larger list of activities and their details to bring better awareness and preparation to guests as well as a space to save their favorite animals/locations and document through notes and media—thereby creating personal album memories from the zoo to download, already organized through the app.</p>"
