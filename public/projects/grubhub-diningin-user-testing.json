            "detail": "<p>For a Usability Evaluation Methods course. My group decided to do a usability test to compare two food order websites, GrubHub and DiningIn. 15 participants tested these sites through tasks that observed the four important areas of ordering online:</p><ol><li>Finding a restaurant</li><li>Browsing and choosing from a menu</li><li>Selecting and customizing menu items</li><li>Checking out the menu options selected</li></ol><p>Post-test data was made up of our qualitative observations, quantitative task measurements during the test, and the users' responses to a post-task questionnaire.</p><p>Our qualitative positive findings included the following:</p><ol><li>Order customization was straightforward and allowed for specialization</li><li>Checkout was easy to navigate and straightforward</li><li>Easy to search for restaurants in order to make orders</li><li>Right-side order summary clearly indicated what guest intended to purchase</li></ol><p>GrubHub's toolbars and navigation in particular made it easier for users to spot actions to take. DiningIn's approximate delivery times helped guests understand the logistics of their order arrival.</p><p>The following deck presents the rest of our qualitative and quantitative findings in addition to our methods and other information from the usability tests.</p>",
