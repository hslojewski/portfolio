Among the CD-ROMs I played as a kid, I mastered touch typing from <i>Adventures in Typing with Timon & Pumbaa</i> created by Disney Interactive. When the Internet became more available, I learned HTML and CSS while playing Neopets. A few years later, I had an internship at the same Disney division that created so many of the games I enjoyed. And soon after that, I was part of a Disney initiative that taught current employees how to code.</p>",
