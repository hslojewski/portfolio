What was beneficial to all teams involved in this project was that the Japan team was able to more quickly migrate these sites by referring to branded style themes that already supported US sites (Disney.com, StarWars.com, etc.) as well as localization tools already available on the CMS platform.</p><p>As the Platform Product Manager, I managed the data migrations from their former sites to map to the data structures and content types of our CMS platform. As the Product Operations side of my team, I onboarded these team members onto the platform, assisted them as they built the sites on the CMS, and shepherded the individual launches of each website. I also ensured that the site was set up for accessible standards and was localized per region based on available CMS tools.</p>",
