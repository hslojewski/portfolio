            "detail": "<p>This assignment required that the <strong>weather</strong> be incorporated into a mobile app. Considerations of how the weather could be inserted into an app included dining and event, wardrobe, and even recipe mobile apps. However, I was most enthusiastic upon realizing a useful way that the weather could be incorporated into one of the most frequently used applications on mobile phones: Messaging.</p><p>The idea behind this concept was based on the already existing functionality of the iOS iMessages in how the app will recognize dates and times in conversation and point them out -- with subtlety -- to the user, who then has the option to add those dates and times to their calendar. One step further, through this assignment, the app would have two requirements:</p><ul><li>Functionally recognize dates, times, and location in conversations and refer to the associated Weather App for for more information</li><li>Refer this useful information in a way that's just as subtle as its current date/time-only functionality</li>",
